            <strong>Nataka Kala Praveena Smt. Rekandar Subhadramma and Sri China
                Venkatrao.</strong> <br>
            Smt. Rekandar Subhadramma(1912-1982), daughter of Vanarasa Govinda Rao and
            Lakshmamma, was born in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. She started her earlier
            education of acting at her father Vanarasa Govinda Rao. She entered the stage in her
            6th year and continued the expedition for 50 years. She grew to the excellence of
            acting as she accompanied the troupe when they travelled to Rangoon and Burma.
            <br><br>
            She got married to Rekandar Chinna Venkat Rao in 1926,she exhibited her extraordinary skill as
            an actress who could play both male and female roles with unusual ease. The popular
            roles are Sri Rama in Lavakusa, Balarama and Dhuryodhana in Kurukshetram, Yama in
            Sati Savitri, Vengalaraya in Bobbili Yuddham, Anjaneya in Lanka Dahanam, the title
            roles in the plays Balanagamma, Harishchandra, Sati Anasuya, Chintamani, and many
            more. All these roles demanded Angika, Vachika and Satvika – the elements of
            virtuosity in a balanced proportion and Subhadramma had equipped herself well in all
            these areas of theatrical exposition and gained a name for her excellent acting
            abilities.<br><br>

                responsibility of training actors and actresses of her company and did justice to it
                with great elan. Because of her inimitable rendering of poems with a stress on the
                bhava and her mellifluous singing, she was regarded as one of the topmost actresses
                of her time.

                Subhadramma was honored by several associations including Andhra Nataka Kala
